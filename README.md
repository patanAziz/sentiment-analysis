💬 Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning & NLP
This project is a Sentiment Analysis System that classifies textual data (such as tweets, reviews, or comments) into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.

📌 Features
Preprocesses real-world text using NLP techniques

Trains a machine learning model to classify sentiment

Supports live predictions on new user input

Achieved high accuracy on the test dataset

🚀 How It Works
Data Preprocessing

Clean the text (lowercase, remove punctuations, stopwords)

Tokenize and lemmatize the text

Feature Extraction

Convert text into numeric vectors using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Model Training

Train a classification model like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM

Prediction

Predict sentiment (Positive / Negative / Neutral) from new input

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK / spaCy

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

EXAMPLE:
>>> predict_sentiment("I love this product!")
Output: Positive

>>> predict_sentiment("It's terrible and I regret buying it.")
Output: Negative

📊 Dataset
Use any labeled dataset like:
Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset (Kaggle)
